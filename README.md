# COMP2160 Game Development – Prac Week 10

## Topics covered:
* Update and FixedUpdate (In-Depth)
* Collisions (In-Depth)
* Gizmos

## Today's Task
In this practical, you will be building a break-out style game to better explore the interactions of the physics engine in Unity, including the way FixedUpdate and Collision events operate. Much like last week, the emphasis is on the technical prototype, but this time with a game at the end.

This practical assumes you have completed the Week 9 practical, so please complete that before trying out this one.

You can check out an implementation here: TODO

### The project
* Break-out style game
* Frame work has prefabs and a basic input system

## Step 1 – Update vs FixedUpdate
* Debugging Update and FixedUpdate, observe differences.

## Step 2 - Observing Collisions
* Debugging OnCollisionEnter, Exit and Stay
* Change colour of objects and observe differences

## Step 4 - Add Gizmos
* Add gizmos to show contact points and normals

## Checkpoint! Save, commit and push your work now

### To receive half marks for today, show your demonstrator:

## Step 4 - Add Player movement
* Add movement for player (which one from last time? Tips around force and velocity)

## Step 5 - Add force based on normals
* Add force to ball based on contact normals

## Step 6 - Bricks are destroyed
* Should be OnCollisionEnter, Exit or Stay?
